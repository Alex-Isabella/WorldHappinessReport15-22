Each year is its own table named Happines_[Year]. I had to update some tables and add a new column called row_number to assign a Happiness_Rank to the tables that were missing it

ALTER TABLE Happiness_21 ADD COLUMN row_number INT;

UPDATE Happiness_21 SET row_number = t.rn
FROM (SELECT Country, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Country) as rn FROM Happiness_21) as t
WHERE Happiness_21.Country = t.Country;

Then renamed the columns Happines_Rank

After that I was able to grab the country and Happiness_Rank for each year using a series of joins

Grabbing the Happiness Rank for each country for each year

SELECT Happiness_15.Country
    ,Happiness_15.Happiness_Rank AS '2015_Rank'
    ,Happiness_16.Happiness_Rank AS '2016_Rank'
    ,Happiness_17.Happiness_Rank AS '2017_Rank'
    ,Happiness_18.Happiness_Rank AS '2018_Rank'
    ,Happiness_19.Happiness_Rank AS '2019_Rank'
    ,Happiness_20.Happiness_Rank AS '2020_Rank'
    ,Happiness_21.Happiness_Rank AS '2021_Rank'
    ,Happiness_22.Happiness_Rank AS '2022_Rank'
FROM Happiness_15
JOIN Happiness_16
ON Happiness_15.Country = Happiness_16.Country
JOIN Happiness_17
ON Happiness_16.Country = Happiness_17.Country
JOIN Happiness_18
ON Happiness_17.Country = Happiness_18.Country
JOIN Happiness_19
ON Happiness_18.Country = Happiness_19.Country
JOIN Happiness_20
ON Happiness_19.Country = Happiness_20.Country
JOIN Happiness_21
ON Happiness_20.Country = Happiness_21.Country
JOIN Happiness_22
ON Happiness_21.Country = Happiness_22.Country;

Here's the top 5 starting with 2015 and going to 2022
